# ReFactor
Simplified Thing-Printer board image generation toolset, based on Debian or Ubuntu images from RCN for beaglebone.

The starting point for ReFactor is the Ubuntu console image, details are in the wiki here:
http://wiki.thing-printer.com/index.php?title=ReFactor

ReFactor is a build-tool to install a printer's Firmware (at the moment Klipper), a printer control interface (OctoPrint or DWC), a touch-screen interface (Toggle w/ OctoPrint, DWC's tbd) and a few miscellaneous items (webcam streamer, network file share for gcode file uploads, etc.). 

It sets a default password for access as root on new images (**root:kamikaze**), but leaves the root account alone otherwise.
SSH is meant to be active and allow root login. The `debian` user is normally also setup and runs OctoPrint and Klipper. Its password is set to `temppwd`. Both root and debian passwords will need to be changed upon first login.

## Usage

The images generated are focused on being a boot-strapped firmware for Thing-Printer control boards, such as Replicape and Recore. However PRs to make ReFactor an image generation tool for a wider range of single-board controllers is completely welcome. To support multiple platforms, the build script usage has been modified:
```
cd <path to Refactor git clone>
sudo ./build-image-in-chroot-end-to-end.sh <platform> [OPTIONAL: system setup script]
```
If not specified, the _ansible-playbook_ that is used is ___SYSTEM_klipper_octoprint-DEFAULT.yml___

The platform (required parameter) is one of:
 * replicape
 * recore
 * pi
 * pi64

The script then exports the `platform` ansible variable, and sources the `BaseLinux/$platform/Linux` file for a number of items:
* a URL for which base linux image to build from (pine64 armbian for `pi64` and `recore`, RCN-built console debian 10.3 for `replicape`, raspbian for `pi`)
* the `decompress()` function, to allow the script to properly decompress the downloaded file and export the image file to where it can be mounted
* additional ansible parameters specific to the platform requirements. For the moment this is where the `platform` gets passed through, as well as the `firmware` variable.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Only the `SYSTEM-[...].yml` playbook files can work with the `build-image-in-chroot-end-to-end.sh` script. The `INSTALL-[...].yml` playbooks are provided as means for end-users to customize their running images. It is inadvisable to run a `SYSTEM-[...].yml` playbook on an already running system. And especially not during a print. That would cause a division by zero and make the printer disappear into its own micro black hole. Or release the magic smoke. Either way, not a good thing. You have been warned.

# Previous image versions

Umikaze 2.1.1 was built on Ubuntu 18.04.1 (LTS) and incorporated OctoPrint, Redeem and Toggle.
To learn more about Umikaze, go to https://github.com/intelligent-agent/Umikaze/wiki

The starting point for Kamikaze 2.0.0 is the Debian IoT image found here: 
https://debian.beagleboard.org/images/

For Kamikaze 1.0:  
    ssh root@kamikaze.local  
    cd /usr/src/  
    git clone http://github.org/eliasbakken/Kamikaze2  
    cd Kamikaze2  
    ./make-kamikaze-1.1.1.sh  

Here is how to recreate for Kamikaze 2.0:  
    ssh root@beaglebone.local  
    cd /usr/src/  
    git clone http://github.org/eliasbakken/Kamikaze2  
    cd Kamikaze2  
    ./make-kamikaze-2.0.0.sh  


The update command will kick the user out from the ssh session.
